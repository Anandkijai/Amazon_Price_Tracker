# Amazon_Price_Tracker
#Description
The Amazon Price Tracker is a web-based application that allows users to track and monitor the prices of products on the Amazon platform. The goal of the project is to provide users with real-time price updates, historical price data, and notifications when the price of a desired product drops to a specified threshold.

Features:

1.Product Search: Users can search for a specific product by entering its name, brand, or keyword. The application will retrieve the relevant product listings from Amazon's database.

2.Price Tracking: Once a product is selected, the application will start tracking its price. It will periodically scrape the Amazon website to retrieve the current price of the product and store it in the database.

3.Historical Price Data: The application will maintain a history of price changes for each product. Users can view the price trends over time through interactive graphs and charts, enabling them to make informed purchasing decisions.

4.Price Drop Notifications: Users can set their desired price threshold for a product. Whenever the price drops below this threshold, the application will send an email or push notification to the user, alerting them of the price change.

5.Price Comparison: The application can also provide users with the ability to compare prices of the same product across different sellers on Amazon. This feature allows users to identify the best available deal for the product they are interested in.

6.User Dashboard: Users will have personalized dashboards where they can manage their tracked products, view their notifications, and customize their tracking preferences.

7.User Authentication: To use the price tracking and notification features, users will need to create an account and authenticate themselves. This allows the application to save their preferences and deliver personalized notifications.

8.Data Privacy: The application will prioritize data privacy and security by implementing necessary measures to protect user information. This includes encryption of sensitive data and following best practices for secure user authentication.

Implementation:

The Amazon Price Tracker can be implemented as a web application using technologies such as Python for web scraping, a backend framework like Django or Flask, and a frontend framework like React or Angular. The application will leverage Amazon's API to retrieve product information and price data.

The web scraping component will periodically scrape the Amazon website using tools like Beautiful Soup or Scrapy to extract the required data. The application will store the data in a database for retrieval and analysis.

The frontend interface will provide an intuitive and user-friendly experience, allowing users to search for products, track prices, set price thresholds, and view historical data and notifications.

Overall, the Amazon Price Tracker aims to empower users by providing them with valuable insights into product pricing on Amazon, helping them make informed purchasing decisions and save money.
